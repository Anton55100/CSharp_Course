## Arrays

* Write a program that allocates array of **20** integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by **5**. Print the obtained array on the console.
* Write a program that reads two arrays from the console and compares them element by element.
* Write a program that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).
* Write a program that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array. Example: {2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1} -> {2, 2, 2}.
* Write a program that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array. Example: {3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4} -> {2, 3, 4}.
* Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array. Example: {4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 9, 3} -> 4 (5 times)
* Write a program that finds in given array of integers a sequence of given sum `S` (if present). Example: {4, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 8}, S=11 -> {4, 2, 5}
* Write a program that creates an array containing all letters from the alphabet (A-Z). Read a word from the console and print the index of each of its letters in the array.
* \* Write a program that reads a number `N` and generates and prints all the **permutations** of the numbers [1...N]. Example: n = 3 -> {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}
* Write a program that reads two numbers `N` and `K` and generates all the **variations** of K elements from the set [1...N]. Example: N = 3, K = 2 -> {1, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 3}
* Write a program that reads two numbers `N` and `K` and generates all the **combinations** of K distinct elements from the set [1...N]. Example: N = 5, K = 2 -> {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}
