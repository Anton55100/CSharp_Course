## Methods

* Write a method that asks the user for his name and prints "Hello, <name>" (for example, "Hello, Peter!").

* Write a method that checks if the element at given position in given array of integers is bigger than its two neighbors (when such exist).
* Write a method that returns the index of the first element in array that is bigger than its neighbors, or -1, if thereâ€™s no such element.
    * Use the method from the previous exercise.
* Write a method that reverses the digits of given decimal number. Example: 256 -> 652
