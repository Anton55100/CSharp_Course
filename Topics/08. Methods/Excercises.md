## Methods

1. Write a method 'GetMax()' with two parameters that returns the bigger of two integers. Write a program that reads 3 integers from the console and prints the biggest of them using the method 'GetMax()'.

2. Write a method that returns the last digit of given integer as an English word. Examples: 512 -> "two", 1024 -> "four", 12309 -> "nine".

3. Write a method that counts how many times given number appears in given array.

4. Write a method that checks if the element at given position in given array of integers is bigger than its two neighbors (when such exist).

5. Write a method that returns the index of the first element in array that is bigger than its neighbors, or -1, if thereâ€™s no such element. (Hint: Use the method from the previous exercise)
